_Create a dependency diagram of your docker images_

> _"Be able to read blueprints, diagrams, floorplans, and other diagrams used in the construction process."_ ~ Marilyn vos Savant

When creating docker containers, it is not uncommon to have several low-level "base" images, which higher-level images are built from.

It would be nice to see which images extend which. This project aims to do that.
